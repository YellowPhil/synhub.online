I'm a 20-year-old cybersecurity engineer who specialises in binary exploitation and enjoys reading about reverse-engineering/malware developement. But my true passion are anekdoti, so yeah, this blog is partly(mostly) about them.

This blog is no holy grail of any specialist, nor this is a reference page. That's just a place where I put my thoughts, that are truly worth sharing. Come join me and I'll tell you some anekdoti on the way!
